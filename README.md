Import statements: The script imports various modules and packages, including logging, argparse, json, uuid, collections.abc, functools, re, contextlib, concurrent.futures, random, tempfile, urllib.parse, urllib3, bs4 (BeautifulSoup), tld (top-level domain extraction), requests, termcolor, and langdetect. These modules are used for different functionalities such as logging, command-line argument parsing, JSON manipulation, URL handling, web scraping, and more.

Class definition: The SocialAnalyzer class is defined, which serves as the main component of the script. It contains various methods for performing social media analysis.

Constructor (__init__ method): The constructor initializes different instance variables and sets up the logging configurations. It takes a silent parameter, which determines whether to print log messages or not.

Class methods: The class defines several methods that perform specific tasks, such as deleting keys from an object, guessing the language of a text, setting up the logger, initializing detections, fetching website URLs, searching and changing values in the website entries, handling top websites, listing all websites, fetching URLs, checking for errors, and more.

Helper functions: The code also includes helper functions within the class, such as check_url for validating URLs, merge_dicts for merging dictionaries, detect_logic for detecting specific patterns in the source code, and detect for performing the main detection logic.

Class Definition:
The script begins by defining a class called "SocialAnalyzer" which encapsulates multiple methods responsible for username detection and profile retrieval tasks.

fetch_url Method:
The "fetch_url" method is in charge of retrieving the URL associated with a specific website and username combination. This function employs web scraping techniques to extract information from the webpage, such as the title, language, text content, and metadata.

find_username_normal Method:
The "find_username_normal" method serves as the primary logic for detecting usernames using a ThreadPoolExecutor. It iterates over the selected websites and submits tasks to fetch URLs for each provided username in the request.

check_user_cli Method:
The "check_user_cli" method represents the primary logic for the Command-Line Interface (CLI). It handles user input processing and executes the username detection and profile retrieval functionalities. This function sets up the logger, initializes the necessary logic, selects websites based on provided options, and calls the "find_username_normal" method.

load_file Method:
The "load_file" method is a helper function that facilitates the downloading and loading of JSON files utilized by the script, such as the list of websites and languages.

init_logic Method:
The "init_logic" method initializes essential components of the script, including loading the JSON files containing website and language information.

run_as_object Method:
The "run_as_object" method is a higher-level function that allows the script to run with various arguments and options. It creates an ARGV object based on the provided arguments and calls the required methods accordingly.
